# PRATYAKSH â€“ AR-based Furniture Visualization

**Pratyaksh** is an augmented reality (AR) application designed to help users visualize bulky furniture (like TVs, sofas, fridges) in their home environment before physically moving or purchasing it. Developed using MATLAB for 3D modeling, Blender for rendering, and MyWebAR for AR deployment, the project offers a smarter way to plan interior spaces.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

| Tool       | Purpose                                           |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **MATLAB** | Depth estimation & 2D-to-3D model generation      |
| **Blender**| Rendering models with color & texture             |
| **MyWebAR**| Deploying models for smartphone-based AR preview  |

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1. **2D Image Collection**: Users take photos of the furniture.
2. **Depth Estimation in MATLAB**: Converts 2D images to 3D (.glTF) models using stereo vision and RGB-D depth maps.
3. **Rendering in Blender**: Adds textures and realistic coloring to the model.
4. **Deployment with MyWebAR**: Final AR model is deployed to smartphones for live, real-time room placement.
