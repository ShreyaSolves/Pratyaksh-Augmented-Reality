# Pratyaksh-Augmented-Reality
PRATYAKSH is an AR-powered furniture visualization tool that allows users to virtually place 3D models of large furniture items in real spaces using smartphones. Built with MATLAB, Blender, and MyWebAR, this project reduces the hassle of physically moving heavy furniture by enabling real-time augmented reality previews.
